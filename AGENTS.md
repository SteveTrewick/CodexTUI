# CodexTUI

- We should create a swift 5 package that uses the TerminalInput and TerminalOuput packages to
build a swift based Terminal User Interface framework.


# Architecture
- Build small, composable components that build up to the full framework

# API
The API should enable composable TUI with minimal setup code and especially minimal layout code.

# Code styling suggestions
- the user likes enums, sets, option sets and generally terse code that is highly composable to the point of resembling a DSL


# Deliverable 
A Swift 5 package that enables composable Terminal User Interface

# You Must
## Use Swift 5 compatible syntax at all times, do not use async/await
## Read the rules in STYLERULES.md
## Apply the coding style rules in STYLERULES.md
## Stop trying to fit initialisers on a single line, ignore 80 column limit

# Compatibility
## Target platform is macOS version 11
## Linux compatibility is desirable, at a mimimum, code should compile for testing on linux
